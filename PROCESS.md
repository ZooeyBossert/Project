Yesterday I discovered that Souncloud no longer provides API's since there is such a hingh demand. Today I sat with Marijn and decided 
to use the Spotify API. This means that the user of the has to have a Spotify account to use is. The iOS SDK is still in beta format so 
it will not be possible to use the commercially. However that was not my intention so that is fine. I finished the prototype and now I
will start looking tutorials on how to use the Spotify API.

Today we had to give a short presentation about the idea of the app and what we have till now. Thanks to some people of the group 
that gave some ideas to expand the app. They gave the idea to maybe suggest playlist based on location or where the playlist was
made by a user. I am still working on the Spotify API.
