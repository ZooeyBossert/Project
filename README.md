# Project Proposal

## Problem
You are traveling somewhere and you and your mate are not sitting next to eachother or a third party wants to listen to the music you're 
listening to. Or you want to throw a party however the neighbours are always complaining about the noise. Or you just want to throw a 
silent disco party but don't want to have all the fuss with the hiring the equipment that you need? 

These problems occur to people of all ages and interest but mostly to people that love music and parties.

## Solution
These problems can all be solved with Silent Disco App! With this app you connect with the phones of you're friends and stream music that 
that will also play on their phones. Save the songs you like and make playlists you can share with friends. When connected to a phone, you 
can add the person to your friends and send invites to join the silent disco. Also whenever a friend is listening to a playlist and is 
nearby you will get a notification. When going to the playlist you can see which song they listen to and decide to join or not.

## Prerequisites
For the music the API of Soundcloud can be used (maybe also the YouTube API). For saving the song Firebase will be used. How to connect 
the phones, I am still figuring out.
