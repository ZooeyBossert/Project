# Project Proposal

## Problem
You are at a party or just hanging with friends where there is music playing. However snot everybody likes the music or some songs. 
It would have been great if you could create playlists with different friends, so when you're together, you will always enjoy the
music!

These problems occur to people of all ages and interest but mostly to people that love music.

## Solution
These problems can all be solved with Musica (not the final name) App! With this app you connect with your friends and create playlists. Save the songs you like and make playlists you can share with friends. 

## Prerequisites
For the music the API of Spotify will be used. For saving the song Firebase will be used.
